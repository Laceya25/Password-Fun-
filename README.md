## The What 

This website was created for the intention of creating a password based on completed prompts, such as special charactors, numbers and lower & uppercase letters. This password generator will keep things safe by never giving you a repeat password. I combined about 10 tutorials on JavaScript together to try and find what worked for me. There are many ways to get to the same result I found so this was a challenging task. Prompts are now my friend.

I found the most challenging was figuring out why it worked to be honest. I had to back track and figure it out why certain changes equaled certain results.
